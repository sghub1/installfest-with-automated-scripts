## Node

We're going to be installing Node. Node (and its various packages) will be
the foundation of a large part of the course.


#### Graphic Install

We'll head over to the nodejs website and to the [install page.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

If asked for the option you **do** want to:
 - add nodejs to your path
 - install npm

**After the install, restart your terminal and navigate back to the installfest directory.**

Verify with this:

```bash
which node

node --version

which npm
```
Each of these is a separate command, they should each print something out on the line below. 

### NPM Packages
Now, we will use Node's associated package manager, `npm`, to download and install some Node
modules and make them available across all of our projects.

```bash
scripts/npm.sh
```
